It will also allow students without ideas to browse through projects and contact students with ideas about joining the projects that interest them.\
        The team in U⋅Start is connected by one shared objective: to make a platform that can help students create projects with aspiring entrepreneurs and have access to a network of professionals to gain experience in their field of interest. In a world where there are seemingly endless networking sites, we aim to differentiate ourselves by providing students access to experienced mentors to help ignite their creative fuel.\
        The beauty of U⋅Start is in the name. We need U to help students create together in ways that are only possible in our diverse network. For us to achieve our goal of helping students achieve theirs, please sign up.');

It will also allow students without ideas to browse through projects and contact students with ideas about joining the projects that interest them. Most internships have become highly competitive and often result in more paperwork than actual work related the student’s field of study. U•Start will finally allow students of all fields of study to gain experience by working on projects the peak their interest and potentially grow it to beyond just a project. The beauty in U•Start is, unlike the platforms that we are used to, it is not niche based in just one field. It has been created with all skillsets in mind. For example a solo musician can find fellow musician, create a band, find a sound engineer and create a demo much faster than before. A coder can find a website using new coding languages that they wanted to learn and gain experience with that new language for their resume.</p>\
<p>Students will no longer need to be limited to the people that they know within their major or even their university, U•Start allows for cross-university communication between students. Many universities and colleges have multiples campuses with different specialties, with this platform students will finally have the ability to reach out to other campuses and universities, to find the students with the specialized skillsets they need for projects.</p>\
<p>U•Start was created in hopes of helping students all around the world give life to their ideas and help them find the resources they need. Too many ideas have lost or given up on that could have made a major difference in the world, due to not having the resources or skillsets needed to create them. \
